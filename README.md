# Usage: 

Open project in Xcode. Select "FILES" folder in project navigator, then move any large data file for which you wish to encrypt and decrypt it. Next step would be to rename constant file name and file extension inside of ViewController.m according to the file which you placed inside of Files folder. 

```
NSString *const LARGE_DATA_FILE = @"YOUR_FILE_NAME";
NSString *const LARGE_DATA_FILE_EXTENSION = @"FILE_EXTENSION";
```
# Best of luck
